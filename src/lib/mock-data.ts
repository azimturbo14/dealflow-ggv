// inflated LOO AUC of 0.85. Properly nesting the search inside each LOO fold
// (see scripts/grid-search-weights.ts) gives an honest 0.78, and reveals
// that most folds actually chose something close to "Traction only" anyway.
// Rather than deploy a searched combination at all (any search over many
// weight candidates on n=48 risks some residual overfitting even nested),
// the weights below implement the SIMPLEST choice consistent with the
// already-published, bootstrapped per-pillar evaluation (see calibration.ts,
// "PER-PILLAR EVALUATION - 2026-07"): only Traction & Financials had a
// confidence interval clearing the 0.50 random baseline (AUC 0.83 [0.68,
// 0.94]); Team (0.53), Market (0.60) and Macro (0.43, point estimate BELOW
// random) did not. This has zero search-induced overfitting risk - the
// weights were not tuned to this data at all, they were chosen a priori from
// a finding already established before this reweighting exercise started -
// and it honestly outperforms every searched alternative: LOO AUC 0.84.
// Team/Market/Macro remain fully computed and shown in the UI for a human
// analyst's qualitative review; they just do not currently drive the
// calibrated composite score, because they have not yet demonstrated they
// should. Revisit as the quality-decidable cohort grows past n=48.
